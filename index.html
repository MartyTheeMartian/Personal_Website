    <h2>About Me:</h2>

        <p>My name is Martin, but you can call me "Marty". I'm from San Francisco.</p>

    <h3>Interests</h3>

        <p>Music is my passion. I play a little bit of guitar and drums. Most of all, I enjoy listening to music.
            Sometimes I go to concerts. Rock music is my favorite genre.</p>

        <p>I have a dog. Her name is Noodlez. She is 9 years old, half Jack Russell, and half Pomeranian.
            She's the cutest dog in the world.</p>

        <p>I like video games, but I don't like playing them. Playing video games is stressful.
        Instead, I enjoy watching them on Twitch. I got to meet some of my internet friends at TwitchCon.</p>
